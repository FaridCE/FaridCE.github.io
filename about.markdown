My name is **Alejandro Farid Cantun Estrella** – I am a mexican physicist researching the foundations and phenomenology of semi‑classical gravity and modern cosmology.  
I work on bridging quantum field theory with general relativity, exploring topics such as quantum back‑reaction, and the interface between early‑universe inflationary models and quantum fluctuations.
